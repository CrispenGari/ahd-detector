Abstract: _`Automatic Humour Detection (AHD) is a very useful topic in morden technologies. In this notebook we are going to create an Artificial Neural Network model using Deep Learning to detect humour in short texts. AHD are very useful because in model technologies such as virtual assistance and chatbots. They help Artificial Virtual Assistance and Bot to detect wether to take the conversation serious or not`._
